- Ensure the JSON object contains the following keys: "name", "link", "instructions" and "ingredients"

- The "ingredients" key should contain an array of objects, each with "name" and "quantity" keys

- Use empty strings for any fields where information is not available in the transcript

- Format the "instructions" as a single string with line breaks between steps

- Standardize ingredient quantities (e.g., "1 cup" instead of "one cup")
